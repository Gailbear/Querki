package querki

/**
 * This package provides the "global imports" that are commonly used across the client. It
 * is specifically intended that most files will say:
 * {{{
 * import querki.globals._
 * }}}
 * It should *not* include the kitchen sink, but if an import is used in more than half of
 * all files, it belongs here. IMPORTANT: overuse of this mechanism will slow compile times,
 * so be thoughtful about what belongs here!
