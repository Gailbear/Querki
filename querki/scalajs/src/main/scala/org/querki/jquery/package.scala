  // Knock on wood, it seems to suffice as a not-100%-general-but-good-enough approach
  // to constructing type unions for facade signatures. It's inefficient, unfortunately,
  // but not so much so as to be a big problem in most client-side code.
  //
  // NOTE: we originally tried doing pseudo-unions for facades using sealed classes that
  // extended js.Any. That turns out to work for simple situations but melts down in the
  // face of complexity: once you have several of them, you wind up with compile failures
  // due to ambiguity -- for instance, you wind up with multiple paths from String to
  // js.Any, and when you hit a function that really *does* take js.Any, the compiler gets
  // confused. Hence this less-efficient but more-robust approach instead.
  //
  // TODO: conceptually, this really belongs in the org.querki.jsext library, since it is
  // a general-purpose mechanism. However, I do *not* want to require calling code to have
  // to include jsext in order to get the imports. We could create a trait that we mix into
  // the jquery package, but I am concerned whether using it in other packages as well might
  // produce implicit conflicts. This therefore needs some experimentation, to see whether
  // it is safe...
